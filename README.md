# InterSchem  
## Overview  
InterSchem is a Scheme interpreter built in C using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to create code through visual blocks, execute it, convert it to C++ code, and save/load their progress for future work.  

## Features  
- **Visual Programming** – Code using visual blocks instead of traditional text-based input.  
- **Scheme Interpretation** – Execute and test Scheme-based logic in real time.  
- **C++ Code Generation** – Convert visual block-based code into equivalent C++ code.  
- **Save/Load Functionality** – Store and retrieve projects for continuous development.  
- **Modular Design** – Built with OOP principles for extensibility and maintainability.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Paradigms**: Object-Oriented Programming
